# Complete Free Track {#complete-free-track}

- **Type:** Wrap-up
- **Audience:** Public
- **Theme:** Consolidation, reproducibility, and next steps
:::

You have completed the Foundations Track of **CDI Data Science Foundations in Python**.

This guide is **Quarto-first**. Every chapter is written as a `.qmd` file and executed during rendering, so the figures and outputs you see are reproducible.

---

## What You Built

Across Lessons 01–06, you built a complete, end-to-end workflow:

- Set up a reproducible Python environment (`.venv`) and rendered a Quarto book  
- Loaded a dataset and saved it into a consistent project structure (`data/`)  
- Cleaned and validated the dataset (`data/iris_clean.csv`)  
- Performed core data wrangling operations (filter, group, reshape)  
- Created foundational visualizations and saved figures reproducibly  
- Produced summary statistics and wrote careful interpretations  

---

## Your Project Structure

Your repo is already organized like a real, reproducible data project:

- `index.qmd` and chapter `.qmd` files define the book content  
- `data/` contains datasets used by the lessons  
- `figures/` stores saved plots created during rendering  
- `cdi_viz/` contains reusable plotting and saving utilities  
- `scripts/bash/` contains build and setup helpers  
- `docs/` contains the rendered website (GitHub Pages output)  

---

## How to Rebuild Anytime

From the project root:

```{bash}
#| label: 06x1-build-book
bash scripts/bash/build.sh
```

After rendering, open the site:

```{bash}
#| label: 06x1-open-site-mac
open docs/index.html
```

:::cdi-message
If you are editing chapters and want live reload, you can use `quarto preview`.
For a quick verification after a build, opening `docs/index.html` is usually sufficient.

## What This Track Did Not Cover

This Foundations Track focused on the core workflow. It did not yet cover:

- Feature engineering and transformation design  
- Train/test splitting and evaluation discipline  
- Supervised learning (classification and regression)  
- Model tuning, validation strategies, and leakage avoidance  
- End-to-end project packaging and deployment workflows  

Those topics belong to the extended track.

## Next Steps

### Solidify your practice
Choose a new dataset (for example: housing, health, finance) and repeat Lessons 02–06.

### Improve readability and reproducibility
Adopt a consistent style:
- clear variable names
- small, named code chunks
- explicit validation checks before saving outputs

### Continue into the extended track
If you want to move from foundations to applied projects, the extended track continues with:

- deeper exploratory analysis  
- feature engineering  
- machine learning workflows  
- model evaluation and interpretation  
- end-to-end project structure and deployment  

---

## Summary

You now have a complete foundation workflow and a reproducible Quarto project that you can reuse for future datasets and future guides.
