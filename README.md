# Data Science Foundations (Free Track)

A structured Quarto book teaching the end-to-end Python workflow from raw data to interpretation.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the free edition of the Complex Data Insights (CDI) Data Science Foundations guide.

The goal is simple:

Move from raw data to interpretable insight using a calm, structured workflow.

This is not a collection of disconnected notebooks.  
It is a complete analytical progression:

Data → Cleaning → Exploration → Visualization → Interpretation

The focus is not only on writing code, but on understanding how analysis moves forward responsibly and coherently.
