# Data Science Foundations (Free Track)

A structured Quarto book teaching the end-to-end Python workflow from raw data to interpretation.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the free edition of the Complex Data Insights (CDI) Data Science Foundations guide.

It teaches two things at the same time:

- How to think through a complete data science workflow  
- How to structure and publish analysis using Quarto  

The result is not just code execution, but a reproducible analytical document.

## What This Guide Covers

- Setting up a reproducible Python environment  
- Loading and understanding structured datasets  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Basic data wrangling  
- Clear and honest visualization  
- Summary statistics and interpretation  
- Building and rendering a Quarto book  

Each chapter builds on the previous one.  
The structure is intentional.

## Why Quarto?

Modern analysis is not only about computation.  
It is also about communication and reproducibility.

Using Quarto, learners see how:

- Code and narrative live together  
- Analysis can be rendered as a structured book  
- Projects can be version-controlled and published  

This makes the workflow complete.
