This project is **purely Python-based**, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.

Before we begin exploring data, you need a simple and reliable workspace
so you can run code smoothly and follow every lesson without issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommended Setup

Use **Jupyter Notebook** via the **Anaconda** distribution.

**Why this option?**

Anaconda installs Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential data-science
libraries in one streamlined setup.

**Steps:**

1.  Download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download\
2.  Install it (default settings are fine)\
3.  Open **Anaconda Navigator**\
4.  Launch **Jupyter Notebook**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tools Used in This Guide

::: cdi-message
This guide uses widely adopted open-source tools from the Python
data-science ecosystem, including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter. These tools form the foundation of
modern data analysis and machine learning workflows.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing Required Libraries

Run the following command in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

``` bash
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Note:**\
> If you are using Anaconda, these libraries are usually preinstalled.\
> The command above ensures your environment is up to date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Practice Dataset

We will use the **Iris dataset** in the early lessons of this guide.

You do **not** need to download it manually at this stage.

-   A later lesson will generate `data/iris.csv` automatically\
-   This lesson focuses only on ensuring your environment is ready

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Your Setup

You may run the test below after the dataset exists:

``` python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data/iris.csv')
print(df.head())
```

Expected output (first rows):

       sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width species
    0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  setosa
    1           4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  setosa
    2           4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  setosa
    3           4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  setosa
    4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  setosa

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

If something does not work as expected:

-   Restart your notebook and try again\
-   Confirm the file path is `data/iris.csv`\
-   Ensure the `data/` folder exists\
-   Re-run the installation command if needed

Setup issues are common. Take your time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercise

-   Confirm that Jupyter Notebook opens successfully\
-   Run the library installation command without errors\
-   Verify that you can run a simple Python cell

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Summary

-   You set up a Python-based data analysis environment\
-   You installed essential data science libraries\
-   You verified that your notebook can execute Python code\
-   You prepared your system for working with real datasets
